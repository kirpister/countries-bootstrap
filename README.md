## Countries App with Redux &#127758;

[Go to live page](https://countries-app-kirpister.vercel.app/)

Aim of this project was to get comfortable with state management using React Redux. We also have a look at authentication with Firebase.
We get the data used in the project from [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). 

Features include register and login using Firebase, after creating an account you get access to country cards where you can add favorite countries to a favorites list. You can view a single country by clicking the card, in this page you can see some basic information, map of the capital via Google Maps and current weather data using Open Weather API.

If you want to have a look at Countries App but don't want to create a user feel free to use the test account:
